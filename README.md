# Harbor

A software factory for Rails apps: a mountable engine that runs agent work.
Workflows whose steps are runs, placed on runtimes through workspaces, executed
by agents with routed models, judged by scorers, improved through proposals,
and triggered by webhooks and schedules.

Harbor is being extracted from Hardcover's internal app, one area at a time.
**It is early.** Today the engine holds the foundation: the section menu, the
settings system and the Settings page. The rest arrives as it is cut free of
the app it came from.

## Setting up

Harbor needs a Rails 8.1+ app on Postgres with a login of its own. It has no
login: its pages are exactly as protected as the controller you give it.

### 1. Add the gem

The gem is `harbor-engine` (the code's namespace is `Harbor`). It is not on
RubyGems yet; add it from this repository, pinned to a release tag:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "harbor-engine", github: "hardcoverapp/harbor-engine", tag: "v0.1.0"
```

```bash
bundle install
```

### 2. Mount it

Mount Harbor last in the host's routes, so the host's own routes win:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Harbor::Engine => "/", as: :harbor
```

Harbor's pages then live at the root (`/settings`). Mount it somewhere else
(`=> "/harbor"`) if the host already uses those paths.

### 3. Migrate

Harbor's migrations run with the host's; nothing is copied into `db/migrate`.

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### 4. Give it a login and a layout

Harbor's pages inherit one of the host's controllers, and with it the host's
login check, layout and current user. The default is `ApplicationController`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/harbor.rb
Harbor.configure do |c|
  c.parent_controller = "ApplicationController"
end
```

**That controller must refuse people who aren't logged in.** If it has no
login check, anyone who can reach the app can change Harbor's settings. Point
`parent_controller` at an admin-only controller if only some users should.

Two things the controller and its layout need:

- A `current_user` method (private is fine), if you want Harbor to record who
  changed a setting.
- Links to the host's own pages that work from inside an engine. In a
  `before_action` or `redirect_to` in that controller, write
  `main_app.login_path`, not a bare `login_path`. Links in the layout need no
  change.

### 5. Show the menu

`Harbor.nav` is the one list of Harbor's pages. Render it wherever the host's
navigation lives:

```erb
<%# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb %>
<% harbor_nav_links.each do |link| %>
  <%= link_to link.label, link.path, class: ("current" if link.active) %>
<% end %>
```

Only entries whose page exists are listed, so today that is Settings plus
anything the host adds:

```ruby
Harbor.configure do |c|
  c.nav.add "Reports", :reports_path, after: "Automations"
end
```

### 6. Styles

Harbor's views use Tailwind utility classes. A host that builds its CSS with
`tailwindcss-rails` adds one line to its `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`,
so Tailwind reads Harbor's views too:

```css
@import "../builds/tailwind/harbor";
```

`tailwindcss-rails` writes that file during its build.

Harbor doesn't ship its own design yet. Its views also expect these class
names to mean something in the host's stylesheet: `card`, `pill`, `meta`,
`display`, `field`, `btn-quiet`, and the colour utilities `bg-pale-green`,
`text-ink-green`, `bg-pale-red`, `text-ink-red`, `text-soft`, `text-ink`,
`border-hairline`. Without them the pages work and look plain.

### 7. Check it

Log in and open `/settings`. You should see the settings grouped under
Workflows, Self-improvement and Runs, each marked "Default". Change one: it
should say "Set here" and by whom. Log out and open `/settings` again: you
should be sent to your login page.

## Switching pages off

Every page in Harbor's menu, except Settings, has a switch under **Pages** on
the Settings page. A site that doesn't use a page turns it off: it leaves the
menu and its URLs answer as not found. Nothing running in the background is
stopped by it.

A page of the host's gets the same switch by giving it a key when adding it,
and gating its controller:

```ruby
# config/initializers/harbor.rb
c.nav.add "Reports", :reports_path, after: "Automations", key: :reports
```

```ruby
class ReportsController < ApplicationController
  include Harbor::PageGate
  harbor_page :reports
end
```

## Configuring

Harbor is configured in three places, and a value goes in the first one it can:

1. **Settings in the app.** Everything that is data: switches, limits, and
   later repositories, identities and task types. Edited on the Settings page;
   a change takes effect at once, with no deploy or restart.
2. **The environment.** Secrets only.
3. **Ruby**, in a host initializer. Only what is code:

```ruby
# config/initializers/harbor.rb
Harbor.configure do |c|
  # The controller Harbor's pages inherit from (step 4).
  c.parent_controller = "ApplicationController"

  # How to name the person who changed a setting.
  c.user_label = ->(user) { user.name }

  # Called with (relative path, text) when saved configuration changes, to
  # keep a copy outside the database. Optional.
  c.export = ->(path, body) do
    file = Rails.root.join("storage", path)
    file.dirname.mkpath
    file.write(body)
  end

  # The host's own pages in Harbor's menu.
  c.nav.add "Reports", :reports_path, after: "Automations"

  # ENV keys a setting used to be read from. The ENV value applies until a
  # value is saved on the Settings page.
  c.env_fallback :workflows_enabled, "MYAPP_WORKFLOWS_ENABLED"
end
```

### Settings

A setting is declared in `lib/harbor/settings/declarations.rb` with a key,
type, default and description, and read with:

```ruby
Harbor::Setting.get(:agent_auto_retries)
```

A saved value wins, then the host's ENV fallback, then the default. The page
shows which of the three each value comes from. An undeclared key can't be
read or saved.

## Rules for code in this repository

- **Harbor does not know its host.** No host's models, repositories, logins,
  paths or URLs, in code, seeds or copy. What Harbor needs from a host arrives
  as a setting or through `Harbor.configure`.
- **A new switch or limit is a declared setting**, not an ENV key.
- **Secrets are never stored in settings.**

## Developing

The tests run against a small host app in `test/dummy`, on Postgres:

```bash
bundle install
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432 bin/test
bundle exec rubocop
```

`DATABASE_URL` names the server and credentials; the database is always
`harbor_dummy_test`.

## Releasing

1. Update `lib/harbor/version.rb` and add the version to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merge to `main`.
3. Tag that commit `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. Hosts pin a tag, so nothing changes for
   them until they move to it.
